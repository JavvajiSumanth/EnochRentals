                Throughout the management of our portfolio of over 150 units,
                CREM Management has consistently exuded transparency, honest and
                a commitment to manage costs as if each property was their own.
                As owners in real estate portfolios themselves, they seemed to
                be directly aligned with our interest in the diligent and
                economically efficient management of our units. They're truly
                that unicorn vendor and we're so happy with our partnership.

                I cannot stress this enough, for any multifamily/retail property
                management needs, CREM Mangement is a must consideration. Their
                management prices are at market but their service, without a
                doubt, is above anything we've experienced on the management
                side. Unfortunately, it took us 4 years, headaches and multiple
                management companies to finally connect.
